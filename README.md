## :clipboard: Features in Detail

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Register** | User registers a master password. Password is hashed + device secret generated. |
| **Login** | Master password is verified securely. On success, session master key is generated. |
| **Failed Login Handling** | After 5 incorrect attempts, application **force closes** to prevent brute force. |
| **Vault** | User can view all saved passwords with decrypted **site name and URL**. |
| **Encryption** | Site name, site URL, username, and password are encrypted separately using `EncryptField`/`DecryptField`. |
| **Search** | User can search credentials by **partial** match of site name, username, or site URL. |
| **Add New** | Add a new credential securely with encryption before saving. |
| **Refresh Button** | Refresh credential list without restarting app. |

- Encryption uses **symmetric key** derived from master password and device-specific secret.
- **ZeroMemory** is used to clean sensitive data from memory after use.
